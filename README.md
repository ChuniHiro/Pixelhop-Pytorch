Experiments On Auxiliary Pixelhop including 
* STATISTICAL ATTENTION LOCALIZATION (SAL) for Data Augmentation
* Supplemental feature generatioin (SFG) for XGBoost performance improvement
* Complementary Nonlinear Learning (CNL) for parallel MLP to form basic learning block
* Pixelhop and XGBoost converted to pytorch models
